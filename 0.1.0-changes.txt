Recent public API changes:

- ATM, auth support requires Python 2.5 (I hope to fix this soon for
  older Pythons).  As a result, the tests are failing for 2.2, 2.3,
  and 2.4.

- mechanize.Browser.default_encoding is gone

- Some mechanize.Browser constructor args have been moved to
  mechanize.Factory (default_encoding, ...)

- mechanize.Factory has changed completely, to make it easier to avoid
  re-parsing (principally: add .set_response() method and make
  factory methods take no args)

- .links no longer raises LinkNotFoundError (was accidental -- only
  .click_link() / .find_link() should raise this)

- .get_links_iter() is gone (use .links() instead)

- .forms() and .links() now both return iterators (in fact, generators),
  not sequences (not really an interface change: these were always
  documented to return iterables, but it will no doubt break some client
  code)

- _authen handler name renamed --> _basicauth

- Rename set_credentials --> set_password_manager (and add some new
  methods)


Changed in SVN fairly recently (since last mechanize release):
 - Browser.encoding() now takes no parameters

 - i_want_broken_xhtml_support moved from Browser to Factory()
