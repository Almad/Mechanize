Recent public API changes:

- ATM, auth support requires Python 2.5 (I hope to fix this soon for
  older Pythons).  As a result, some tests fail for 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4.

- Some mechanize.Browser constructor args have been moved to
  mechanize.Factory (default_encoding, ...).

- .get_links_iter() is gone (use .links() instead).

- .forms() and .links() now both return iterators (in fact, generators),
  not sequences (not really an interface change: these were always
  documented to return iterables, but it will no doubt break some client
  code).

- .links no longer raises LinkNotFoundError (was accidental -- only
  .click_link() / .find_link() should raise this).

- Rename set_credentials --> set_password_manager (and add some new
  methods to improve auth and proxy support).

- mechanize.Factory has changed completely, to make it easier to avoid
  re-parsing (principally: add .set_response() method and make
  factory methods take no args)

- mechanize.Browser.default_encoding is gone.

- Added Browser.encoding().

- Factory() takes an i_want_broken_xhtml_support argument, as a stop
  gap until I actually make a proper job of it.  Without a true value
  for that argument, mechanize is ignorant of XML/XHTML.

- _authen handler name renamed --> _basicauth
