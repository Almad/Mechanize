mechanize installation instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NOTE: This file describes the old-fashioned install.

I now recommend using EasyInstall instead.

See the web page for EasyInstall instructions (included here as
README.html).

If you use EasyInstall, you should ignore the rest of this file.


Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

See the web page for the version of Python required (included here as
README.html).

See setup.py for the required Python packages.


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install the package, run the following command:

 python setup.py build

then (with appropriate permissions)

 python setup.py easy_install --no-deps .


Alternatively, just copy the whole mechanize directory into your
Python path (eg. unix: /usr/local/lib/python2.2/site-packages,
Windows: C:\Python21, or C:\Python22\Lib\site-packages).  That's all
that setup.py does.  Only copy the ClientCookie directory that's
inside the distributed tarball / zip archive, not the entire
mechanize-x.x.x directory!


To run the tests (none of which access the network), run the following
command:

 python test.py

This runs the tests against the source files extracted from the
package.  For help on command line options:

 python test.py --help
